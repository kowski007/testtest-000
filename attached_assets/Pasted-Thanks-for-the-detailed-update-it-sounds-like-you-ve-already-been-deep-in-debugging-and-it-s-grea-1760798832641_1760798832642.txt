Thanks for the detailed update ‚Äî it sounds like you've already been deep in debugging, and it's great that you're narrowing it down. Here's a clear summary and next steps, based on what you've shared and the core issue:

---

## ‚úÖ Summary of What Was Fixed:

### 1. **[object Object] URLs**

* **Cause**: Code was using `notification.coinId`, but the schema has `coinAddress`, not `coinId`.
* **Fix**: Updated navigation to use `notification.coinAddress`.

### 2. **Trade Modal Tabs Not Working**

* **Cause**: Invalid `onSlideChange` prop on the `Carousel` (likely Embla).
* **Fix**: Replaced with `setApi` and `useEffect` to handle the carousel's `select` event properly.

---

## ‚úÖ Actions Taken:

* Edited `client/src/pages/notifications.tsx`
* Edited `client/src/components/trade-modal.tsx`
* Carousel API calls fixed (desktop + mobile modals)
* You confirmed changes were implemented and app restarted

---

## ‚ùìIf You're Still Seeing `[object Object]` URLs:

Here are **a few possibilities why it may still appear**, despite the fixes:

---

### üîÅ 1. **Multiple Places Still Using Object Instead of String**

You fixed it in `notifications.tsx`, but similar logic might exist elsewhere.

**Next step:**
Run this search again (if not done thoroughly yet):

```bash
rg -n --glob '*.tsx' 'to=\{.*\}' .
```

Look for usages like:

```tsx
<Link to={{ pathname: '/some-path' }} />
```

or:

```tsx
<Link to={someObject} />
```

And change them to:

```tsx
<Link to="/some-path" />
```

or:

```tsx
<Link to={someObject.path} />
```

---

### üì• 2. **Dynamic Navigation Using Object in `setLocation()` or `navigate()`**

If you're using `wouter` (or `useLocation`), make sure you are not calling:

```tsx
setLocation({ path: '/trade' }); // ‚ùå BAD
```

You should call:

```tsx
setLocation('/trade'); // ‚úÖ GOOD
```

---

### üß™ 3. **Console Debug: Log the Value Before Navigation**

Before any navigation call (e.g., `setLocation(...)`, `window.location.href = ...`, etc.), do:

```js
console.log("Navigating to:", routeValue, typeof routeValue);
```

If it logs:

```
Navigating to: [object Object] 'object'
```

Then you're still passing an object somewhere.

---

### üìå 4. **Check Any Button or Click Handlers That Do Routing**

Sometimes the `onClick` handler is written like:

```tsx
onClick={() => setLocation(tradeData)}
```

But `tradeData` might be an object like:

```js
{ path: '/trade/BTC', coin: 'BTC' }
```

You need to explicitly extract the string path:

```tsx
onClick={() => setLocation(tradeData?.path)}
```

## ‚úÖ Recap: What You Should Double-Check Now

| File / Area                              | What to Check                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| All `Link` usages                        | Ensure `to` is a string, not an object                  |
| All `setLocation()` / `navigate()` calls | Only pass a string path                                 |
| Console logs                             | Confirm you're not logging `[object Object]` before nav |
| Trade Modal Tabs                         | Confirm interaction works after `onSlideChange` fix     |
| Other modals / pages                     | May still have leftover incorrect navigation code       |

---

## ‚úÖ Final Tip ‚Äî Add a Debug Guard:

To help catch this early, add a helper like:

```js
function safeNavigate(path) {
  if (typeof path !== 'string') {
    console.error("Invalid navigation path:", path);
    return;
  }
  setLocation(path);
}
```

Then use `safeNavigate()` instead of calling `setLocation()` directly.

## üëÄ Want Me to Review a Specific Snippet?

If you paste a section of code you're unsure about, I can point out the exact mistake.

Let me know if you want help scanning other parts like:

* Sidebar menu clicks
* Search or coin cards
* Mobile nav menus
* Notification click handlers

You're very close ‚Äî one or two remaining places probably still pass objects instead of strings.
